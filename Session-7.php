    /* The back-ends of websites will differ depending on the needs of the site. Typically, theyâ€™ll have at least the following components:

    A web server: a web server is a computer or program which listens for requests from clients and sends back responses. This component is well suited to handling delivery of static content.
    An application server: this is actually often a collection of programming logic which is needed to deliver dynamic content to a client. The application server will often handle other tasks such as site security and interacting with data.
    A data base: important information like usernames and passwords has to be stored and accessed somewhere. A large web application will often have multiple databases to store all different types of data needed to run the site smoothly.
