# Associative Arrays

# By using a map, we can associate keys with values. A key is a string or integer that we use to acces a value (Of any type).

# We could create a map with a key of "fullname" and a value of "Stuart White", this is more understandable than associating the name with an index 0.

# We can then access the value by using the associated key.

# In the ordered arrays we have been previously using, they are implemented as a map. The index locations are the keys. 

# Associative arrays allow us to assign more meaningful keys to a value, as opposed to indices.

# Associative arrays are collections of key=>value pairs. 

# The key must be either a string or an integer, while the values held can be any type.

# We use the (=>) operator to associate a key with it's value.

# Associative arrays can use integers as keys as well as strings.

# With ordered arrays in PHP the numerical key association to values is done automaticalls for us.

# The structure of an ordered array is the same as an associative array.

# When we add an element to an array without a specific key, such as using array_push(), PHP will associate it with the next integer key.

# If no integer keys have been used it will associate it with the key 0.

# If integer keys have been previously used, then it will assign it the key one larger than the largest integer used so far.

# This behaviour is the same whether using ordered array or associative ones.
